  \end{array}
\right.
\]
where $c$ is a normalization constant. Find $\E(X\mid Y)$.

\item Let $Y_t=W_t^3-tW_t^4$. Find $\E(Y_t)$ and $\Var(Y_t)$.  You don’t have to use Ito Lemma here.
\item Let $X_n$ be a discrete time stochastic process that converges in probability to a random number $X$ as $n\to \infty$. Does this condition imply that $X_n$ converges to $X$ in mean? Almost surely? In distribution? Support at least one of your answers with a proof or counterexample. Give a definition for each type of convergence. 
\item Seek to optimize the integral 
$\int_0^{\frac{\ln 2}{2}} (4u-u^2-x-3x^2)\,dt$
subject to the conditions $\dot{x}=u+x$, $x(0)=5/8$, $x\left(\frac{\ln 2}{2}\right)$ is free. Find $x$, $u$, $\lambda$. What kind of optimum did you find?

\item Consider the following optimization problem: maximize 
$\sum_0^{\infty} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^t \ln c_t$
, subject to $c_t+k_{t+1}=\sqrt{k_t}$, $k_0>0$. Let the state variable be $k$ and denote the next period value of $k$ as $k'$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down the Bellman equation for the value function $V(k)$
\item Using method of undetermined coefficients find $V(k)$
\item Find the optimal policy function $k'=h(k)$ 
\end{enumerate} 

\end{enumerate}

Part B.
Answer both questions from this section. Each question is worth 20 points.
Part B lasts for 60 minutes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $X_t$ be a stochastic process such that
$dX_t=\frac{X_{\infty}-X_t}{\tau}dt+\sigma dW_t$, where $X_{\infty}$ and $\tau$ are non-random constants, $W_t$ is a Wiener process, and let $Y_t=X_t e^{t/\tau}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use Ito Lemma to find both differential and integral expressions for $Y_t$ and use them to express $X_t$ (a.s.) in terms of $X_{\infty}$, $X_0$, $\tau$, $\sigma$ and $t$. Here $X_0$ is the value of $X_t$ at time $t=0$.
\item Find $\E(X_t)$ and $\Var(X_t)$. Sketch the graph of $\E(X_t)$ as a function of $t$ for $X_{\infty}=1$, $\tau=1$, and $X_0 = 0$, $1$, and $2$. Plot a possible trajectory of $X_t$ in each case. Is there any name or names associated with $X_t$? 
\end{enumerate}

\item Utility $U(C,P)=U_1(C)+U_2(P)$ increases with the consumption $C$ and decreases with the level of pollution $P$. For $C>0$, $P>0$ it is known that $U'_1>0$, $U''_1<0$, $U'_2<0$ and $U''_2<0$. It is known that $\lim_{C\to 0} U'_1(C)=\infty$ and $\lim_{P\to 0} U'_2(C)=0$. 

Consumption lies within the range $0\leq C\leq \bar{C}$. Consumption contributes to pollution, while pollution control reduces it; moreover environment absorbs pollution at a constant rate $b>0$.  Pollution dynamics is governed by equation $\dot{P}=C^2-(C^*)^2-bP$ in which the first two terms represent the net contribution to the pollution flow, where $0<C^*<\bar{C}$. 

Consider the problem of maximizing the discounted ($r>0$) utility stream

Section A.  10 points for each problem.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve the bounded control problem with the free end value where $T>1$ is specified in advance but $x(T)$ is not.
\begin{equation}
\int_0^T(x-u)\,dt\to \max,\, x(0)=1 \nonumber
\end{equation}
$x'=u$, $0\leq u\leq x$. What guarantees that a maximizer would be found?

\item Two stochastic processes are defined by the system of SDE with the Brownian motions $W_{1t}$, $W_{2t}$ independent of each other
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
dX_t=(2+5t+X_t)dt+3dW_{1t} \\
dY_t=4Y_t dt+8Y_t dW_{1t}+6dW_{2t} \nonumber
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Calculate $d(X_t Y_t)$

\item Find the value of the constant $a$ such that the process $X_t=W_t^3-a\int_0^t W_s\,ds$ is a martingale.

\end{enumerate}

Section B. 20 points for each problem. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The goal of this exercise is to solve the SDE

Assuming that the market is in the equilibrium we use the inverse demand function $p(nx)$, where $p'(y)<0$. Equation defining the dynamics of labor is given by $\frac{dl}{dt}=a(w-\bar{w})$, where $a>0$  and $\bar{w}$  is some equilibrium wage rate. The growth (or fall) in number of firms is governed by the equation $\frac{dn}{dt}=b(px-\bar{w}l-\bar{r})$, where $b>0$. Write down the system of ODE for the unknowns $l(t)$, $n(t)$, using the first-order condition for the profit-maximizing firm, find and classify the steady-state solutions (if any exist).

\end{enumerate}

\section{2012-2013}

\subsection{Exam, 10.01.2013}

\textbf{Optimal control part}.  

\vspace{20pt}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $[$10 points] Solve the optimal control problem 
$\int_0^1 (x+u)\, dt \to \max$
subject to $\dot{x}=-x+u+t$, $x(0)=0$, $x(1)$ is free, and $0\leq u\leq 1$.

\item $[$10 points] Consider an intertemporal utility maximization problem over the finite horizon in discrete time $t=1,\ldots,T$. The utility is $u(c)=\ln c$, the initial wealth is $w$ and if the remaining wealth at time $t$ was $w_t$, then by the beginning of the next period it becomes $w_{t+1}=(1+r)(w_t-c_t)$, where $r$ is the discount rate and $c_t$ is the consumption.  To find the maximum value of the utility stream one can use the finite version of the Bellman equation written in the form
$V_t(w)=\max \{ u(c) + V_{t+1}((1+r)(w-c)) \}$
where the function within the braces is maximized over the values of $0 \leq c \leq w$. It is important to note that the value function $V_t$ is the maximum value of the utility stream from time $t$ onwards.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $[$3 points] Let $V_T=\ln w$. Find $V_{T-1}$.
\item $[$7 points] Try to verify the conjecture that 
$V_t=\gamma_t \ln (1+r) + (T-t+1) \ln \frac{w}{T-t+1} $
where $\gamma_t$ is some (unknown) function of time.
\end{enumerate}

\item $[$20 points] A spill of toxic substance should be cleaned up by a company.  If a cleanup rate is $u(t)$, then the area of the spill shrinks by the law 
$x(t)=x_0-\int_0^t u(s)\, ds$
, where $x_0$ is the initial area. According to the government contract by the time $T$ (and not earlier) the area of the spill should  be reduced to $x_T$, where $x_T<x_0$.  Clearly $u(t)\geq 0$, and by technology requirement $u(t)\leq \bar{u}$, where $\bar{u}>(x_0-x_T)/T$. Costs of cleaning are directly proportional to $u(t)$. Let the unit costs equal $c>0$ and the costs are discounted with the discount rate $r>0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $[$5 points] Formulate the minimization problem with the bounded control. Hint: this is a fixed endpoints problem.
\item $[$15 points] By using the current value Hamiltonian set the system of equations and solve it.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
